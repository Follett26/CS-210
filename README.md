Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project I submitted is an investment application that allows a user to input different percentages and amounts to see what investment gain would be made in the future.

What did you do particularly well?
  I was pretty proud of myself for getting good with the inline comments. Ever since I started coding I have struggled with remembering to make comments in my code, but with this project I took my time and reminded myself to include those comments to become a more fundamental coder.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could possibly enhance my code to be a little more visually appealing. Even after the first time I ran it successfully, I still had somewhat of a hard time reading it. I did make a couple tweeks to make things line up better and easier to read but would like to make it look even neater.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I have always struggled with for statements, so when it got the the mathmatical part of the code and had to use for statements, I struggled a lot there.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Like I said before, this project really helped me wrap my head around the importance of inline comments. They saved me so many times from being confused on what the different parts of my code were really doing. It was a skill that I think will stick with me to help me with future projects and course work.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I felt I did a good job of proper spacing in the code that made it not look so jumbled. Sometimes when I write code I have a tendency to do really good spacing in the code in some places and then complete forget that the space bar is on my keyboard in other places. For the most, it was all pretty spaced and easy to read.
